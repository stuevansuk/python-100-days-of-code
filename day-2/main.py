#Data Types

#String Data Type, Print Character of String using [] Subscripting
print("Hello"[4])
print("123") 

#Integer - Use _ to make number eeasier readable in code, program will drop them
print(123 + 345)
print(123_456_789)

#Float number with decimal point 3.142

#Boolean, are either True or Fale

#Converting Data Types
num_char = len(input("what is you name? : "))
str_num_char = str(num_char)
print("Your name has " + str_num_char + " characters!")

#Prints Type will be a float
a = 123
print(type(a))

#Prints Type, will be a string
a = str(123)
print(type(a))

#Prints type, will be a float
a = float(123)
print(type(a))

# Will print the addition of 70 + 100.5 becuase these are int and flots
print (70 +float(100.5))

#Will print 70100 as this is defining numbers as a string
print (str(79) + str(100))

#Challenge 
#Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8
#Example input = 39 Exmple output 3 + 9 = 12

num_1 = int(input("Number 1 : "))

number_1 = int(two_digit_number[0]) # Gets 1st Character of the String and sets it as an integer.
number_2 = int(two_digit_number[1])
result = number_1 + number_2
print(result)
